		++++===<| Update 17 Noclip Gaming |>===++++

		=== General ===

* Finished the enchantment system. The enchantment menu can be opened/closed with TAB. While an enchantment is Active, a
   character can become enchanted by interacting with any cauldron. Enchantments are not consumed when a character obtains
   one, though only one character can be enchanted at once.
	* Sublevel 5 is currently acting as the enchantment testing area. You should be able to walk through the wall in it after
	   giving a character the Ghost Enchantment.

* Player characters now have color coded silhouettes while ghosting inside a platform. 
	# Custom Stencil Depth gaming.

* Interacting with a cauldron now removes the enchantment from the last character to use one: Only one character may be enchanted
  at a time.

* Characters now lose their enchantment when a new level is loaded. Cauldrons also reset to have no enchantment.

* The game *might* have controller support now. I just have a PS4 controller, so I can't test if it is broken or just me. :(

		=== Bugfixes ===

* Fixed a bug where characters could highlight interactables without being controlled as long as they have never been swapped to.

* Fixed a bug where Ghosted characters could pass through level entrances/exits.

* Fixed a bug where character messages could decay while the game was paused.
	# > Didn't know UE had a premade pause state

	++ Technical ++

* Numbers no longer get printed to the screen whenever the Game State deletes a player character.

* The "Ghostable" variable Moving Platforms have should now properly prevent Moving Platforms from being ghosted through.
	# UE5 doesn't like it when you set the collision object type in the constructor?


		++++===<| Update 16 Vo?d Gaming |>===++++

		=== General ===

* Added rooves to the Map2 levels. 
	* The interiors are currently lit by a Post-Processing volume with an Ambient Cubemap. The volume has been named
	   "--> Placeholder Lighting <--". Hide it in the outliner to turn off the lighting.

* Added message boxes. These are cubes that display a message when interacted with.

* The Witch's flight now ends if she is swapped from.
	# Characters should be immobile while not being controlled by the player unless a platform moves them.

* Increased the range of the Techie's kinesis by another 100 units.

* The entrance doors to levels (the one you come from) are now pink while the exit doors are now black.
	# If the player backtracks to a previous puzzle, the puzzle they were already on completely resets! I want to make sure
	   this basically never happens on accident.

* Level Load Airlock doors peek 10 units less from the floor while open. Walking through them should be a slightly less bumpy
  ride.

* Added cauldrons. Currently, they just give interacting characters the ability to walk through moving platforms/doors.
	* These aren't currently in any level, so you'll have to spawn one. Good luck not falling through the floor randomly!
	# No, this is not finished yet.

	=== Map 2 Sublevel 1 (Wittch Intro) ===

* The lower level no longer has a floor material on the ceiling.

	=== Map 2 Sublevel 3 (Anti-Magic Barriers) ===

* The green gate now peeks out from the walls a bit while opened. This should make it consistent with how other moving platforms
   in the game peek from floors/walls.

* Made the red door transparent so that it is obvious at a glance that it is the exit door.

	=== Map 2 Sublevel 4 (The Big One) ===

* The green platform now lowers an extra 100 units when triggered, making it level with the upper floor of the red door area.
	# This should make it a bit more obvious that the Techie can grab the crate that spawns on the platform.

* Moved the blue button slightly more to the left to compensate for the Techie's increased kinesis range.

		=== Bugfixes ===

* Level Load Airlocks now wait until all of its doors are closed to unload levels and will no longer give players looking behind them
  a frightening glimpse at That Which Lies Beyond.

* The Techie now properly despawns when backtracking from M2S2 to M2S1 instead of falling infinitely into [?he Ab?ss].
	# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9VMfdG873E

* The Witch can no longer press the blue elevator tech console at the top floor of M2S3.
	* If there are any other tech console she was able to press, those should be fixed too. Forgot to set something in the
	   blueprint class!

* The cyan door in M2S3 is now the correct height.

	++ Technical ++

* The player should now automatically mark any Actor with a MarkedObjects Component. If every this functionality is ever unwanted,
   there is a Player Markable value that can be editted in each MarkedObject Component instance.

		!!!! Known Issues !!!!

* Player Characters go through crates that are held by other characters.
	# I'm putting this one on the backburner since this interaction isn't really intrusive to gameplay.

* Crates get launched unusually high when a moving platform lifts them.

* Percival's box levitation is still stiff. Also, rotating while pulling a crate toward you also rotates the crate.

* Characters appear to be standing on nothing when standing on Liftable Jump Pads. Animation while walking on them is generally
  awkward. I *think* this is just cosmetic since the offending collider isn't suppose to effect anything other than linetraces.


		++++===<| Update 15 Fat Update Gaming |>===++++

		=== General ===

* Added M2S3 and M2S4.

* Added Anti Magic Barriers. The Witch cannot travel through these while they are active. Some can be turned off via switches.

* Switches and triggerable actors can now be Cyan.
	# I ran out of colors in one test...
	# Also, technically they could always be cyan, but the color was named "Exit" before. I never actually ended up using the
	   "Exit" trigger for anything.

* Finally replaced the BSP's of Map1's level load airlocks with static meshes.

		=== Player Characters ===

* The detection for interacting with objects is now based on where the camera is facing instead of the character. Currently, this 
   does not account for if the player is looking up or down, so you should not have to aim up or down at interactables; Only side to
   side.
	# This feels a bit awkward to me sometimes. Let me know if you guys feel the same: I can revert the change and try just
	   bumping up the character turn rate.

* The line trace for character interacting is now 125 units higher.
	* This change is intended to allow The Techie to grab crates that are slightly above him (up to 120 units from his feet to be
	   exact). Before this change, it was possible for The Techie to levitate a crate somewhere but be unable to pull it back due
	   to the levitation keeping objects above his head.
	* The interactions height for buttons and tech consoles have been adjusted accordingly.

* Extended the Techie's levitate/kinesis range from 1200 to 1500.
	# This is in response to feedback about the Techie needing to stand too close to the edge of platforms to grab crates that
	    he is suppose to be able to grab. This also makes it easier to make areas that require the Techie to levitate a crate far
	    away without the Strongman being able to jump out and toss the crate instead.

* The Witch no longer gets knocked back by the doors of level airlocks. No more getting knocked back into the loading zone and
   unloading the next level by accident!
	# Things I Hate About Unreal 247: Despite the presence of a corresponding output pin suggesting otherwise, Hit Results
	    from hit events do not return Physics Materials by default. The actor detecting the collision (Not the actor being collided
	    with as the option's title might make you assume!) needs to have "Return Material On Move" checked in its collision
	    settings. It's even under the "Advanced" section just so you don't accidently gaze upon the setting with your virgin eyes
	    and realize you need it. If you don't have the setting checked, the Hit Physics Material will return nothing and if you
	    only needed the material's type like I did, Unreal will not so much as grace you with an error message, leaving you
	    scratching your head to extents that will make the mighty grizzly envious.

	=== Map 1 Sublevel 1 (Strongman Intro) ===

* Adjusted the position of the crate spawning pressure plate so that it can't be stepped on accidently after grabbing the crate.
	
	=== Map 1 Sublevel 2 (The Techie Intro) ===

* Adjusted the position of the crate spawning pressure plate so that it can't be stepped on accidently after grabbing the crate.
	
* Widened the Red button room a tad bit so that it is harder to levitate the crate into a wall before reaches the pressure plate.

* The red door now peeks a bit from the floor when lowered like all the other doors/platforms in the game do.

	=== Map 1 Sublevel 2 (Two Red Doors) ===

* Adjusted the position and height of the platform the crate spawns on so that it does not look like The Techie should be able to grab
  the crate (Also, he would be able to grab it anyway after the change to the interaction height).

	=== Map 2 Sublevel 1 (The Witch Intro) ===

* The last surviving stairs in the game have been replaced with ramps.

* More walls have been added.

# I might replace the pillars with floating blocks. What I want is something that will force players to toy around with the Witches
   flight and get used to how it controls

	=== Map 2 Sublevel 2 (The "All Character" Puzzle) ===

* You now only need the Witch to backtrackto M2S1.

* M2S2 now has a pit before the level proper this is to keep the Techie and Strongman from backtracking with the Witch to M2S1.

* The green platform now takes half the time to move (1s => 0.5s).

* Added a secret.
	# SPOILER: If you noticed a strange hole in the wall under that very steep ramp, that's why that was there.

		=== Bugfixes ===

* Backtracking has been fixed across the board. You should now be able to access every room of any level you are backtracking to.

* The Witch no longer falls through the floor when spawning on Map2.

* Bruno now correctly displays different dialog when trying to interact with a tech panel, instead of just saying his button lines.

* Bruno no longer tosses crates super high when moving in the Y axis.
	# Bruno hooping a crate somewhere he isn't suppose to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUVcFlyNNzU

* Buttons/Tech Consoles are now correctly highlighted by characters who cannot use them.

* Crates now despawn when the sublevel it was spawned in unloads. No more crate duping!

		!!!! Known Issues !!!!

* Levels unload before the loading airlock closes, giving players looking behind them a brief view of [TH? V?ID].
	# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r0RnCD2Zs0

* Player Characters go through crates that are held by other characters.
	# I'm putting this one on the backburner since this interaction isn't really intrusive to gameplay.

* Crates get launched unusually high when a moving platform lifts them.

* Percival's box levitation is still stiff. Also, rotating while pulling a crate toward you also rotates the crate.

* Characters appear to be standing on nothing when standing on Liftable Jump Pads. Animation while walking on them is generally
  awkward. I *think* this is just cosmetic since the offending collider isn't suppose to effect anything other than linetraces.


		++++===<| Update 14 Together Gaming |>===++++

* Added Map2 Sublevel 2. This one has all of the characters!
	* There aren't any rooves on this one yet. Just in case, you shouldn't need to fly above the walls anywhere to beat the
	   level.

* Added tech consoles that only the Techie can use, which are introduced in Map2 Sublevel2. They currently have a placeholder
  model and texture that looks like a multicolored cylinder with a button on it.

* The Witch is now Map2's starting character and there is now a spawn point for her.

* A dialog box now pops up when a character tries to interact with something that they can't use.

* The Witch is no longer knocked back if her flight ends due to hitting the ground.

		!!!! Known Issues !!!!

* Levels unload before the loading airlock closes, giving players looking behind them a brief view of [TH? V?ID].

	# I'm putting this one on the backburner since this interaction isn't really intrusive to gameplay.

* Crates get launched unusually high when a moving platform lifts them.

* Sometimes, Bruno tosses a crate way up high for no apparent reason.

* Percival's box levitation is still stiff. Also, rotating while pulling a crate toward you also rotates the crate.

* Characters appear to be standing on nothing when standing on Liftable Jump Pads. Animation while walking on them is generally
  awkward. I *think* this is just cosmetic since the offending collider isn't suppose to effect anything other than linetraces.

* The Techie's area in Map1Sublevel 2 is inaccessible when backtracked to unless the player goes in and out of Sublevel 1 first.
	* This is not as obvious to fix as it appears...

* Backtracking from M1S2 to M1S1 does not work due to the doors blocking the player.
	# I need to rework how backtracking is programmed.

		++++===<| Update 13 Outline Gaming |>===++++

* Crates and buttons now become outlined when a character being controlled is able to interact with them.

		!!!! Known Issues !!!!

* Player Characters go through crates that are held by other characters.
	# I'm putting this one on the backburner since this interaction isn't really intrusive to gameplay.

* Crates get launched unusually high when a moving platform lifts them.

* Sometimes, Bruno tosses a crate way up high for no apparent reason.

* The Techie's area in Map1Sublevel 2 is inaccessible when backtracked to unless the player goes in and out of Sublevel 1 first.
	* This is not as obvious to fix as it appears...

	++ Technical ++

* For anyone messing around with the Marked Object Component. It now requires you to set a Mesh To Mark value for it to mark
   anything. Previously, it would mark whichever mesh it felt like marking, which was not consistent even for blueprints of the same
   class.


		++++===<| Update 12 Ramp Gaming |>===++++

* Replaced all stairs in Map1 with ramps.

* Fixed an obnoxiously bright test light in Map1Sublevel2.

* The Solutions txt file that the game comes with has been rewritten as a general Readme with the controls and character abilities
   added.

		=== Bugfixes ===

* Fixed a bug where pressure plates would sometimes no longer work when Map1Sublevel1 is backtracked to.

		!!!! Known Issues !!!!

* Player Characters go through crates that are held by other characters.
	# I'm putting this one on the backburner since this interaction isn't really intrusive to gameplay.

	* This is not as obvious to fix as it appears...


		++++===<| Update 11 Stuck Gaming |>===++++

* Moving Platforms are now color coded based on what triggers them.

* Buttons now have their updated models and textures.
	* To compensate for how narrow the model is, I've expanded the button's collision with a collider that can only be hit
	   by raycasts.

* Made the orange door in Sublevel 1 and blue door in Sublevel 2 open when the levels are backtracked into (so players can
  actually enter the level!).

* The blue platform in sublevel 3 now comes out the side of the all instead of rising from the floor.
	# Solution Spoiler: Now you need the crate to press the button and be levitated to the other side instead of a character
	   being able to be brought up with the blue platform.

* The beginnings of Map2 are present, but not ready yet. ;)

		=== Bugfixes ===

* Fixed the Z-Fighting when the walls in the second room of Sublevel 1 and Techie area of Sublevel 2 were lowered.

* Moved Sublevel's 3's red pressure plate so that players could not get themselves stuck in the right room.
	# I'll probably move the button back to it's original position and make an easter egg out of getting stuck.

* The Techie no longer tosses whatever he's holding when swapped away from.

		!!!! Known Issues !!!!

* Player Characters go through crates that are held by other characters.
	# I'm putting this one on the backburner since this interaction isn't really intrusive to gameplay.

		++++===<| Update 10 Sepia Gaming |>===++++

		== General ==

* Added ceilings to each level.

* Added placeholder lighting. 
	* All placeholder lights have been given a yellow tint to help tell them apart from any finished lighting put in place. They
	  also have their own folder in the outliner.
	* All placeholder lights should be in the "Map1PlaceholderLighting" sublevel. Hiding this sublevel should also turn off the
	  lights.
		* The skylight (named "SkyLight" in the outliner) responsible for the level's ambient lighting is still in the 
                               Persistent level.

* The Actors in the outliner have been organized into folders.

		=== Bugfixes ===

* Fixed a bug where a player character carrying a crate would sometimes bump into the crate if they jumped with it.

		!!!! Known Issues !!!!

* Player Characters go through crates that are held by other characters.
	# I'm putting this one on the backburner since this interaction isn't really intrusive to gameplay.

		++++===<| Update 9 Wall Gaming |>===++++

	== General ==

* Walls and floors now have their proper textures.

* Levels now have exterior walls.
	# I didn't place any ceilings because it made the rooms too dark. We'll have to figure out lighting in the future.

* Pressure plates now animate when pressed/unpressed.

* The symbol on pressure plates now glow while triggered.
	* In particular toggled plates ("O") glow until pressed again while "Pressed" plates ("X") only glow while pressed.
	* "Once" pressure plates ("!") used for crate spawns always glow.

		!!!! Known Issues !!!!

* Crates get launched unusually high when a moving platform lifts them.

* Sometimes, Bruno tosses a crate way up high for no apparent reason.

* Percival's box levitation is still stiff. Also, rotating while pulling a crate toward you also rotates the crate.

		++++===<| Update 8 Style Gaming |>===++++

	== General ==

* Characters now have different colored bodies so that testers can tell the apart. The Strongman is red, the Techie is green, and
   the Witch is yellow.
	* I also just now realised that UE5 has a male mannequinn model.

* Pressure plates now have their new model and texture.

	== Bugfixes ==

* The door in front of Sublevel 2's exit now lowers to the correct height.

* Sublevel 2's secret area is now raised to the correct height.

		!!!! Known Issues !!!!

* Crates get launched unusually high when a moving platform lifts them.

* Sometimes, Bruno tosses a crate way up high for no apparent reason.

		++++===<| Update 7 and A Half "Spicy Fix" |>===++++
		
	== Bugfixes ==

* Sublevel 3 now loads at the right height. Percy is now allowed to enter it.

		++++===<| Update 7 "I Hate UE Physics Gaming" |>===++++

	== General ==

* Added level 3. If you got stuck or want to make sure you didn't "break" the puzzle, check "Solutions.txt".
	* Just so you know, though there are no exterior walls, the Interior walls I placed *should* keep you from breaking the
	   puzzle.

* Added exit halls between sublevels. If every character is in the center of the exit hall, the next sublevel loads, the door to that level
  opens, and the door to the previous level closes. Returning all characters to the exit hall allows you to backtrack.
	* The exit hall leading to/from the Percy's introduction is special; Only Bruno is needed to backtrack to the previous
	   sublevel.

* Crates no longer teleport to their position when lifted and now instead float to their position above the character. If the crate hits
  anything along the way, the grab is cancelled and the crate is dropped.

* Bruno can no longer toss the crate far away and now always drops it in front of him.
	# I thought this ability had too much overlap with Percy's general ability to move and grab crates from afar. It is possible
	   for this ability to make a return, however.

* Bruno can now backtrack to Sublevel 1 from Sublevel 2 without needing a crate to reach the entrance.

	++ Technical ++
 
* Character swapping is now handled by the Game State blueprint instead of a Game Manager. Game States are automatically
   created whenever a level in Unreal is created, so you shouldn't have to do any setup if you make a new level for some reason.

* It is not longer spelled "BP_MovingPlaform".

	== Bugfixes ==

* Fixed an issue where moving platforms would sometime not move crates set on them, either leaving the crate floating mid-air
   or simply passing through the crate as it rose.
	# Things I Hate About Unreal Engine #85: Physics actors will "fall asleep" if not interacted with for a few frames to 
	   help with performance, except if the actor falls sleep while touching a second actor that has no physics, it will not wake
	   up if the second actor moves, even if this would leave the physics actor suspended in mid air.
		# If you run into this same issue, create a Physics Material and set the Sleep Velocity Linear and Sleep
		   Velocity Angular Thresholds to 0. Maybe set the Sleep Counter Threshold to 0 just in case.
		# This took me 4 hours to figure out...
		# https://twitter.com/PPathole/status/1187193709609119744

* You can no longer try to swap characters while only one character is in play.

	!!!! Known Issues !!!!

* Crates get launched unusually high when a moving platform lifts them.

* Sometimes, Bruno tosses a crate way up high for no apparent reason.

* Percival's box levitation is still stiff. Also, rotating while pulling a crate toward you also rotates the crate.
		 
			
		++++===<| Update 6 "Witch Gaming" |>===++++
	
	== General ==

* Added the Witch!
	* Jumping mid-air activates her flight: She will fly wherever the camera is facing. Jumping again causes her to stop
	   flying.
		* Pressing forward while flying makes her move faster. Pressing back causes her to slow down.
		* If she bumps into anything, she'll get booped and knock out her flight. She won't be able to control her
		   movements for a split second, so watch out!
	* She is currently in Map 2. She is only here for testing purposes and not meant to be a part of that level.

* You can now press [R] to swap to the previous character.

* Percival's movement is now disabled while levitating something forward.

* If Percival is levitating something forward when swapped from, he will now drop whatever he is levitating.

* The new textures have been integrated:
	* Boxes now have the new model and texture. The height at which boxes are held has been adjusted to fit the new model's pivot
	   being at the bottom instead of the center.

* Added a blueprint component that turns actors into Jump Pads; If a player character is overlapping the actor, their jump velocity will be
  set to that of the Jump Pad Component's as long as it is higher. Percy can even use them!
	# In the future, these will be used to get Percy and Bruno up to places they can't reach with their normal jump.

* Map 2 can now official be completed!

* Added a blueprint for collectables. They have an adjustable bouncing and rotating animation.

* Added two secret areas:
	* One is in Map1's starting room. This is opened by pressing the orange button in the next room and using that room's
	   crate to backtrack to the starting room.
	* The second is above Map2: This is reached by standing on the door on the glass wall and closing it.

* Added a Liftable Jump Pad. It's a Jump Pad characters can pick up and throw around. You don't have to look down at the pad to pick
  it up; looking above it will do. You can use this actor if you want to test Jump Pads.
	
	== Switches/Triggered Actors ==
	
* Switches now have an "Other Actors to Trigger" array that can be editted on each instance. Actors added to this array are triggered by the
  switch irregardless of their color. 

* Switches and Triggered Actors can now be Colorless.
	* Colorless Switches only trigger actors added to their "Other Actors to Trigger" array, even if a Triggerable outside the array
	   is Colorless like the Switch is!
	* Colorless Triggerables can only be triggered by Switches that have added them to their "Other Actors to Trigger" array. Switches
	   will never otherwise trigger Colorless Triggerables, even if the switch itself is Colorless.

* Object Spawners now show their display name and what they will spawn as text. The text color is based on the Object Spawner's Trigger
  Color. This text is hidden during gameplay.

* The Exit color is now Cyan instead a confusingly-close-to-purple magenta.

	== Bugfixes ==

* Fixed a bug where characters would not have physics unless swapped to.

* Fixed a bug where Percival could give an object he's holding collision if the player swaps characters the moment his 

* Fixed a bug in which liftable objects would remember every character that picked them up and cancel the charge-up of their throws 
   when destroyed.
	# This was the obscure bug I was talking about ;)

	!!!! Known Issues !!!!

 * Percival's box levitation is still stiff.

* Characters appear to be standing on nothing when standing on Liftable Jump Pads. Animation while walking on them is generally
  awkward. I *think* this is just cosmetic since the offending collider isn't suppose to effect anything other than linetraces.


		++++===<| Update 5 "Pro Crate Gaming" |>===++++

	== General ==

* The physics of liftable actors have been adjusted:
	* Their center-of-mass is set so that they are now bottom-heavy: This should keep crates from tipping over when tossed.
	* The physics material has more friction and a bit of bounciness to help flatten their landings a bit more.

* Liftable actors are now held above the player's head and no longer have collision/physics while held.

* Throwing liftables has been overhauled:
	* Tapping the throw button now tosses the liftable so that it lands right in front of you.
	* Holding and releasing the throw button as Bruno allows him to throw objects farther.
	* Holding the throw button as Percival allows him to levitate the box forward until either the button is released or a max range
	  is hit.

	!!!! Known Issues !!!!

 * Percival's box levitation is a bit stiff.

 * Moving while levitating something as Percival is probably wonky. 
	* I'll probably just stop him from moving while levitating in the future.

 * Characters (still) neither update their physics nor their animations when swapped from.


		++++===<| Update 4 "Techie Gaming" |>===++++

	== General ==

* Added the Strongman character "Bruno".
	* He can't press buttons, but can jump.

* Added the Techie character "Percival"
	* He can press buttons but can't jump.
	* His self-modified Gucci wheelchair allows him to move 30% faster.
	* His personal Mobeus Psionic Amplifier allows him to grab boxes from up to 12 meters away.

* If a character is holding an actor, other characters may grab it from them as if picking the object up from the ground.

* Crates no longer have Angular Dampening, which reduced all rotational force drastically.
	* This means they should no longer teeter in slow motion when placed off a ledge.

	++ Technical ++

* Sublevels have been renamed to the format "Map#Sublevel#" instead of "Map#Area#". This way, the map format makes more sense at a
  glance.

* BP_CharacterBase now has separate event graphs for movement inputs and "action" (Interacting, Character Swapping, etc.) inputs.
	* From now on (assuming I missed nothing), the default event graph will only be used for default Unreal events such as Tick and
	  begin play.

	!!!! Known Issues !!!!

* Crates currently have non-standard physics when grabbed.
	* They go through objects that they land into during the player's jump.
	* They can easily be pushed through objects while grabbed.
	* They don't play nice with stairs.

* Characters neither update their physics nor their animations when swapped from. 
	* Bruno can fly!


		++++===<| Update 3 "Button Gaming" |>===++++
 
(Make sure you select the Map1 level and not any of its sublevels!)

	== General ==

* Area 3 is mostly blocked out. You still only have one character, so it's not yet playable. The button that would spawn a ramp and button
  that would open the exit currently does not function.

* Buttons have been added. Press "E" while close to one to press it.

* A level streaming actor has been added. The future idea is to have an "air lock" room between sublevels to hide the loading.

* There is a test area next to Area 1 for trying out different door sizes. The hole in the ground is in case we want a hatch.


		++++===<| Update 2 "Crate Gaming" |>===++++
	
	== General ==

* You can now properly lift and put down the crate. Stand close to it and press "E". The crate can even press buttons!
	* To spawn the crate, press the yellow button in the second room (the one with the glass walls).

* Spawners have been added. They can spawn any class of Actor. Like a crate, for instance.
	* Spawners can only have one of their Actors spawned at a time. When a new Actor is spawned, the old one is deleted.

* The second room has been completed. Note that the current rooms are highly liable to be sledgehammered and redesigned.
	* In the very near future, I will create a room design document.

* Pressure plates have a placeholder texture and material.

* The long platform used to see if the Character could B-Hop is gone forever...

	++ Technical ++

* On the off chance one of you need/want to edit something, most if not all Blueprints as well as their variables and functions have
   descriptions. Don't be afraid to ask if I accidently did an impression of UE's documentation (i.e. explained something poorly/not at all)

* The ThirdPersonCharacter folder has been deleted. The game mode file is in Blueprints/Misc and the Default Map is in Levels.
